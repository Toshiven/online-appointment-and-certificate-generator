# Why Legacy?

-   This branch will preserve the state in which this project is before making major changes.
-   The requirements massively changed as we no need to remove the client side features and make the project entirely dashboard only (we can't afford a server and a domain so yeah).
-   The changes will be implemented in the main branch.
